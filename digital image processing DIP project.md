digital image processing DIP project
lab3 Use two of provided images to perform the following operations
through write functions:
5. Sharpen images with Laplacian and Sobel operators respectively through masking process
6. Gamma correction using gamma value 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and compute the variances of the resulted images
7. Write histogram enhancement function to perform global and local image enhancement

lab4 2D DFT 

lab5  1. Filter lena.pgm and camera.pgm using IDLPF, BLPF, GLPF
2. Use HPF and thresholding to sharpen 
  lab6  1. Use a homomorphic filter to enhance bridge.pgm and goldhill.pgm
3. Add sinusoidal noise to lena.pgm and use bandreject filter to recover lena.pgm
4. template matching

lab6        Use a homomorphic filter to enhance bridge.pgm and goldhill.pgm filter

lab7    get the noise patterns and to design filters to remove or reduce the noise
arithmetic mean filter, geometric mean filter, median filter, Alpha-trimmed mean filter, and adaptive median filter

lab8  Define two structural elements, perform binary dilation, erosion, opening, and closing operations on noisy_fingerprint.pgm and noise_rectangle.pgm
